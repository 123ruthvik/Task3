            Mysterious Pokémon types are Mythical Pokémon (rare event-exclusive 'mons like Mew, Celebi, Arceus) or the idea of new types (like "Cosmic"), but also include gameplay oddities, such as Psyduck's hidden Psychic power or early-game glitches/unidentified Pokémon. Some types themselves have mysteries, like how Ghost-type was weak to Psychic in Gen 1, or the origins of Paradox Pokémon like Great Tusk, which seem connected to ancient times. 
            Types of Pokémon Mysteries
            Mythical Pokémon: Extremely rare Pokémon obtained through special events, embodying myth and legend (e.g., Mew, Jirachi, Arceus, Zarude).
            Paradox Pokémon: Ancient or future versions of existing Pokémon (like Great Tusk/Donphan) found in Area Zero, linked to Terapagos and time travel.
            Unidentified/Glitched Pokémon: Early Pokémon manga featured unnamed or strange-looking Pokémon, like a Slowbro with a Gligar's head, that never became official.
            Hidden Potential: Pokémon like Psyduck have lore suggesting untapped powers (Psychic) that only manifest under certain conditions (headaches), making their typing seem strange initially.
            Unused/Fan-Made Types: Concepts like a "Cosmic" type have been proposed, with Pokémon like Solrock or Necrozma fitting the theme, though they received existing types instead.
