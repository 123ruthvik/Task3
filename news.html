        <h2>Pokémon News</h2>
        <p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A continues to expand — its DLC “Mega Dimension” is almost here. A new form, Z Mega Evolution, is confirmed, with the first Pokémon to use it being Mega Lucario (with special defensive and agility-focused boosts). The DLC will also bring new story content, additional Mega Evolutions (including Mega Zeraora), and an increased level cap. 
                The spin-off puzzle game Pokémon Friends — announced earlier in 2025 — has been released (on mobile and Nintendo Switch). It offers a more relaxed, casual experience, letting players solve puzzles and craft plush items. 
                Looking ahead: a new game called Pokémon Champions — a turn-based strategy spin-off — is slated for release in 2026. It’s expected to support features like Mega Evolution, Dynamax, Z-Moves, and will be cross-platform across Nintendo Switch and mobile devices.</p>
